1530253434.0,OctaFX_Official,"BTCUSD FURTHER LOSSES EXPECTED BELOW $5,848","
 Bitcoin 0.68%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.68%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.68%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.68%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.68%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.70%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.70%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.70%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.70%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.70%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.70%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered  

This is more than 2.000.000.000,00 USD per day almoust the  volume  of  American Express 0.01%  0.01%

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.72%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.72%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.72%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.72%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.72%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.72%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.73%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.02%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.73%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.75%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.75%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.75%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.75%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.75%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

1530249731.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Remains Neutral Despite 4% Decline on Friday,"
 Bitcoin 0.74%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.74%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.74%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.74%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.74%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.74%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.74%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.74%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.74%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.04%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.74%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.76%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.76%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.76%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.76%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.76%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin 0.76%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.76%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.78%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.78%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.78%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.78%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.78%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.78%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.78%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.78%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.78%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.78%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.78%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

On the  BTC 0.78% daily chart , is in a short-term  downward channel  from the beginning of May until the end of June. The break out is imminent. We'll probably rally at the beginning of July. I think a reasonable target is around 7700-8100.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.73%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.73%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.73%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.73%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.73%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.73%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered  

This is more than 2.000.000.000,00 USD per day almoust the  volume  of  American Express 0.01%  0.01%

Trends change because of set pattern in time.  

1. Trends change due to a set path and pattern that Man can not deviate from; we are slaves to this pattern.  
2. The pattern that price follows is as static and natural as anything in nature: the rotation of the planets, the Fibonacci ratio, the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.

June 22nd - Jul7th is where we will see a reversal beginning in  Bitcoin 0.72%  0.66% . When the dynamic angular and Square time cycles, that have been applied to price, fail to initiate reversal points, the static time cycles WILL.

Observe the  DXY -0.49%  -0.45% (  Dollar Index              -0.04% ), that will reverse as well: it has already shown signs of it's trend reversal.

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD              for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin              rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin              quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD              will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD              will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin              rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.72%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.25%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.72%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin              has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin              will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin              which might see  Bitcoin              move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin              so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin              has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin              will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin              has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD              so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD              buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD              pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD              pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved. 

I will continue to update this analysis if enough people request it.

1530249731.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Remains Neutral Despite 4% Decline on Friday,"
 Bitcoin              has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin              will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.67%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.67%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.67%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.67%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.67%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.63%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.63%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.63%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.63%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.63%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.63%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.63%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.63%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.63%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.63%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.63%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.63%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.63%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 1.21%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.63%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.64%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.64%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.64%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.64%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.64%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.

Time is the reason for trend changes and price action.  

1. Trends do not change due to sentiment.  
2. Trends do not change due to news.  
3. Trends do not change due to Tweets.  
4. Trends do not change due to dynamic areas of  support and resistance  .  
5. Trends do not change due to a moving average crossover.  
6. Trends do not change due to oscillators being in elevated conditions.  
7. Trends do not change due to  trend lines  .  

Trends change because of set pattern in time.  

1. Trends change due to a set path and pattern that Man can not deviate from; we are slaves to this pattern.  
2. The pattern that price follows is as static and natural as anything in nature: the rotation of the planets, the Fibonacci ratio, the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.  

You can believe or not believe, but  Gann  believed God created all of Creation.  Gann  also concluded that it was imposible for there to be randomness in nature or in human behavior, that a God who created everything must have a supreme order and logic to His creation.  

June 22nd - Jul7th is where we will see a reversal beginning in  Bitcoin 0.57%  0.66% . When the dynamic angular and Square time cycles, that have been applied to price, fail to initiate reversal points, the static time cycles WILL. June 22nd - July 7th is one of those static time cycles. Observe the  DXY -0.48%  -0.45% (  Dollar Index -0.23%  -0.04% ), that will reverse as well: it has already shown signs of it's trend reversal.  

Consider the following as well:  

July 1st - Uranus (harbinger of change in financial markets) exits Taurus (Taurus, the bull, is the money and stock market) indicating change.   

June 26th - One of the most important things to watch this year: Mars Retrograde cycle -  Bitcoin 0.57%  0.66% is very sensitive to anything with Mars.  Gann  said Mars is the 'trigger' for trends and activity.

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.55%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.55%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.55%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.55%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.55%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.55%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.55%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 1.18%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.55%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.55%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.55%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.55%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.55%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.55%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin 0.55%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.55%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.55%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.55%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.55%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.55%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.55%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.55%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.55%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.55%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.55%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.55%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.55%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered  

This is more than 2.000.000.000,00 USD per day almoust the  volume  of  American Express 0.01%  0.01%

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.60%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.60%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.60%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.60%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.60%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.60%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.61%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.61%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.61%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.61%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.61%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.61%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.61%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 1.16%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.61%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.61%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.61%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.61%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.61%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.61%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin 0.62%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.62%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin              has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD              so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD              buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures.

Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.65%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.65%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.65%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.64%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 1.16%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.64%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.65%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.65%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.65%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.65%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.65%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

1530249731.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Remains Neutral Despite 4% Decline on Friday,"
 Bitcoin 0.65%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.65%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.65%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.65%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.65%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.65%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.65%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

When the dynamic angular and Square time cycles, that have been applied to price, fail to initiate reversal points, the static time cycles WILL.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.65%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.65%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.65%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.65%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.65%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.65%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.68%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.68%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.68%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD              for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin              rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin              quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD              will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD              will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin              rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.68%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.28%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.68%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin              has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin              will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin              which might see  Bitcoin              move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin              so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin              has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin              will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin              has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD              so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD              buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD              pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD              pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.71%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.71%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

1530253434.0,OctaFX_Official,"BTCUSD FURTHER LOSSES EXPECTED BELOW $5,848","
 Bitcoin 0.67%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.67%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.67%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.67%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.67%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.68%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.68%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.68%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.68%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.68%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.68%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered  

This is more than 2.000.000.000,00 USD per day almoust the  volume  of  American Express 0.01%  0.01%

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.68%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.68%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.68%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.68%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.68%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.68%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.68%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 1.16%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.68%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin              has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin              will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin              which might see  Bitcoin              move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin              so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved. 

I will continue to update this analysis if enough people request it.

1530249731.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Remains Neutral Despite 4% Decline on Friday,"
 Bitcoin 0.68%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.68%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.67%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.67%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.67%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.67%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.67%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.67%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.68%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.07%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.68%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.74%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.74%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.74%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.74%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.74%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin 0.74%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.74%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.68%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.68%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.68%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.68%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.68%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.68%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.68%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.68%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.68%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.68%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.68%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

On the  BTC 0.72% daily chart , is in a short-term  downward channel  from the beginning of May until the end of June. The break out is imminent. We'll probably rally at the beginning of July. I think a reasonable target is around 7700-8100.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.72%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.72%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.72%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.72%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.72%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.72%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered  

This is more than 2.000.000.000,00 USD per day almoust the  volume  of  American Express 0.01%  0.01%

Time is the reason for trend changes and price action.  

1. Trends do not change due to sentiment.  
2. Trends do not change due to news.  
3. Trends do not change due to Tweets.  
4. Trends do not change due to dynamic areas of  support and resistance  .  
5. Trends do not change due to a moving average crossover.  
6. Trends do not change due to oscillators being in elevated conditions.  
7. Trends do not change due to  trend lines  .  

Trends change because of set pattern in time.  

1. Trends change due to a set path and pattern that Man can not deviate from; we are slaves to this pattern.  
2. The pattern that price follows is as static and natural as anything in nature: the rotation of the planets, the Fibonacci ratio, the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.  

You can believe or not believe, but  Gann  believed God created all of Creation.  Gann  also concluded that it was imposible for there to be randomness in nature or in human behavior, that a God who created everything must have a supreme order and logic to His creation.  

June 22nd - Jul7th is where we will see a reversal beginning in  Bitcoin 0.72%  0.66% . When the dynamic angular and Square time cycles, that have been applied to price, fail to initiate reversal points, the static time cycles WILL. June 22nd - July 7th is one of those static time cycles. Observe the  DXY -0.39%  -0.45% (  Dollar Index -0.06%  -0.04% ), that will reverse as well: it has already shown signs of it's trend reversal.  

Consider the following as well:  

July 1st - Uranus (harbinger of change in financial markets) exits Taurus (Taurus, the bull, is the money and stock market) indicating change.   

June 26th - One of the most important things to watch this year: Mars Retrograde cycle -  Bitcoin 0.72%  0.66% is very sensitive to anything with Mars.  Gann  said Mars is the 'trigger' for trends and activity.

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.72%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.72%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.72%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.72%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.72%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.72%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.72%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.28%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.72%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin              has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin              will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin              which might see  Bitcoin              move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin              so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin              has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin              will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin              has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD              so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD              buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD              pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD              pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved. 

I will continue to update this analysis if enough people request it.

1530249731.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Remains Neutral Despite 4% Decline on Friday,"
 Bitcoin              has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin              will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.68%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.68%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.68%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.68%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.68%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

7. Trends do not change due to  trend lines  .  

Trends change because of set pattern in time.  

1. Trends change due to a set path and pattern that Man can not deviate from; we are slaves to this pattern.  
2. The pattern that price follows is as static and natural as anything in nature: the rotation of the planets, the Fibonacci ratio, the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.  

You can believe or not believe, but  Gann  believed God created all of Creation.  Gann  also concluded that it was imposible for there to be randomness in nature or in human behavior, that a God who created everything must have a supreme order and logic to His creation.  

June 22nd - Jul7th is where we will see a reversal beginning in  Bitcoin 0.68%  0.87% . When the dynamic angular and Square time cycles, that have been applied to price, fail to initiate reversal points, the static time cycles WILL. June 22nd - July 7th is one of those static time cycles. Observe the  DXY              -0.46% (  Dollar Index              -0.02% ), that will reverse as well: it has already shown signs of it's trend reversal.  

Consider the following as well:  

July 1st - Uranus (harbinger of change in financial markets) exits Taurus (Taurus, the bull, is the money and stock market) indicating change.   

June 26th - One of the most important things to watch this year: Mars Retrograde cycle -  Bitcoin 0.68%  0.87% is very sensitive to anything with Mars.  Gann  said Mars is the 'trigger' for trends and activity.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.63%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.63%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.63%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.63%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.63%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.63%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.63%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.63%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.63%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.63%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.63%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.63%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.63%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.06%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.63%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

Time is the reason for trend changes and price action.  

1. Trends do not change due to sentiment.  
2. Trends do not change due to news.  
3. Trends do not change due to Tweets.  
4. Trends do not change due to dynamic areas of  support and resistance  .  
5. Trends do not change due to a moving average crossover.  
6. Trends do not change due to oscillators being in elevated conditions.  
7. Trends do not change due to  trend lines  .  

Trends change because of set pattern in time.  

1. Trends change due to a set path and pattern that Man can not deviate from; we are slaves to this pattern.  
2. The pattern that price follows is as static and natural as anything in nature: the rotation of the planets, the Fibonacci ratio, the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.  

You can believe or not believe, but  Gann  believed God created all of Creation.  Gann  also concluded that it was imposible for there to be randomness in nature or in human behavior, that a God who created everything must have a supreme order and logic to His creation.  

June 22nd - Jul7th is where we will see a reversal beginning in  Bitcoin 0.71%  0.66% . When the dynamic angular and Square time cycles, that have been applied to price, fail to initiate reversal points, the static time cycles WILL. June 22nd - July 7th is one of those static time cycles. Observe the  DXY -0.36%  -0.45% (  Dollar Index -0.02%  -0.04% ), that will reverse as well: it has already shown signs of it's trend reversal.  

Consider the following as well:  

July 1st - Uranus (harbinger of change in financial markets) exits Taurus (Taurus, the bull, is the money and stock market) indicating change.   

June 26th - One of the most important things to watch this year: Mars Retrograde cycle -  Bitcoin 0.71%  0.66% is very sensitive to anything with Mars.  Gann  said Mars is the 'trigger' for trends and activity.

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.70%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.70%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.70%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.70%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.70%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.70%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.70%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.04%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.70%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.70%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.70%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.70%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.70%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.70%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin 0.72%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.72%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.70%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.70%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.70%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.70%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.70%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.72%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.72%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.72%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.72%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.72%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.72%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered  

This is more than 2.000.000.000,00 USD per day almoust the  volume  of  American Express 0.01%  0.01%

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.70%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.70%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.70%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.70%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.70%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.70%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD              for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin              rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin              quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD              will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD              will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin              rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin              is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III              top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC              could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin              has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin              will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin              which might see  Bitcoin              move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin              so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin              has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin              will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin              has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD              so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD              buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD              pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels.

Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.66%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.66%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.66%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.66%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.03%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.66%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.65%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.65%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.65%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.65%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.65%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

1530249731.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Remains Neutral Despite 4% Decline on Friday,"
 Bitcoin 0.66%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.66%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.65%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.65%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.65%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.65%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.65%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

When the dynamic angular and Square time cycles, that have been applied to price, fail to initiate reversal points, the static time cycles WILL.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.68%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.68%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.68%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.68%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.68%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.68%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered  

This is more than 2.000.000.000,00 USD per day almoust the  volume  of  American Express 0.01%  0.01%

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.68%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.68%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

4. Trends do not change due to dynamic areas of  support and resistance  .

7. Trends do not change due to  trend lines  .  

Trends change because of set pattern in time.  

1. Trends change due to a set path and pattern that Man can not deviate from; we are slaves to this pattern.  
2. The pattern that price follows is as static and natural as anything in nature: the rotation of the planets, the Fibonacci ratio, the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.  

You can believe or not believe, but  Gann  believed God created all of Creation.  Gann  also concluded that it was imposible for there to be randomness in nature or in human behavior, that a God who created everything must have a supreme order and logic to His creation.  

June 22nd - Jul7th is where we will see a reversal beginning in  Bitcoin 0.70%  0.66% . When the dynamic angular and Square time cycles, that have been applied to price, fail to initiate reversal points, the static time cycles WILL. June 22nd - July 7th is one of those static time cycles. Observe the  DXY -0.40%  -0.45% (  Dollar Index -0.05%  -0.04% ), that will reverse as well: it has already shown signs of it's trend reversal.  

Consider the following as well:

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD              for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin              rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin              quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD              will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD              will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin              rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.70%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 1.10%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.70%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.73%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.73%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.73%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.73%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.73%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin              has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin              will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin              has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD              so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD              buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD              pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD              pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.72%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

 Bitcoin 0.72%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.72%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.72%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.72%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.72%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.72%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.72%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.72%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.72%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.72%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.72%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD              for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin              rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin              quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD              will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD              will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin              rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.72%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.20%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.72%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin              has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin              will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin              which might see  Bitcoin              move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin              so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin 0.72%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.72%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD              for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin              rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin              quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD              will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD              will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin              rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.74%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.03%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.74%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.74%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.74%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.74%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.74%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.74%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin 0.74%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.74%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.75%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.75%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.75%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.75%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.75%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.78%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.78%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.78%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.78%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.78%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.78%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

On the  BTC 0.88% daily chart , is in a short-term  downward channel  from the beginning of May until the end of June. The break out is imminent. We'll probably rally at the beginning of July. I think a reasonable target is around 7700-8100.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.87%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.87%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.87%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.87%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.87%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.87%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered  

This is more than 2.000.000.000,00 USD per day almoust the  volume  of  American Express 0.01%  0.01%

4. Trends do not change due to dynamic areas of  support and resistance  .

7. Trends do not change due to  trend lines  .  

Trends change because of set pattern in time.  

1. Trends change due to a set path and pattern that Man can not deviate from; we are slaves to this pattern.  
2. The pattern that price follows is as static and natural as anything in nature: the rotation of the planets, the Fibonacci ratio, the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.  

You can believe or not believe, but  Gann  believed God created all of Creation.  Gann  also concluded that it was imposible for there to be randomness in nature or in human behavior, that a God who created everything must have a supreme order and logic to His creation.  

June 22nd - Jul7th is where we will see a reversal beginning in  Bitcoin 0.87%  0.66% . When the dynamic angular and Square time cycles, that have been applied to price, fail to initiate reversal points, the static time cycles WILL. June 22nd - July 7th is one of those static time cycles. Observe the  DXY -0.40%  -0.45% (  Dollar Index -0.02%  -0.04% ), that will reverse as well: it has already shown signs of it's trend reversal.  

Consider the following as well:

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD              for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin              rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin              quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD              will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD              will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin              rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.87%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 1.11%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.87%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.87%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.87%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.87%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.87%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.87%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin 0.87%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.87%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.87%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.87%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.87%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.87%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.87%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved. 

I will continue to update this analysis if enough people request it.

1530249731.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Remains Neutral Despite 4% Decline on Friday,"
 Bitcoin 0.80%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.80%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.79%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.79%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.79%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.79%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.79%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.80%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.80%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.80%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.80%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.80%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.80%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.80%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.80%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.80%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.80%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.80%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.80%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.80%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.04%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.80%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

Time is the reason for trend changes and price action.  

1. Trends do not change due to sentiment.  
2. Trends do not change due to news.  
3. Trends do not change due to Tweets.  
4. Trends do not change due to dynamic areas of  support and resistance  .  
5. Trends do not change due to a moving average crossover.  
6. Trends do not change due to oscillators being in elevated conditions.  
7. Trends do not change due to  trend lines  .  

Trends change because of set pattern in time.  

1. Trends change due to a set path and pattern that Man can not deviate from; we are slaves to this pattern.  
2. The pattern that price follows is as static and natural as anything in nature: the rotation of the planets, the Fibonacci ratio, the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.  

You can believe or not believe, but  Gann  believed God created all of Creation.  Gann  also concluded that it was imposible for there to be randomness in nature or in human behavior, that a God who created everything must have a supreme order and logic to His creation.  

June 22nd - Jul7th is where we will see a reversal beginning in  Bitcoin 0.81%  0.66% . When the dynamic angular and Square time cycles, that have been applied to price, fail to initiate reversal points, the static time cycles WILL. June 22nd - July 7th is one of those static time cycles. Observe the  DXY -0.41%  -0.45% (  Dollar Index -0.04%  -0.04% ), that will reverse as well: it has already shown signs of it's trend reversal.  

Consider the following as well:  

July 1st - Uranus (harbinger of change in financial markets) exits Taurus (Taurus, the bull, is the money and stock market) indicating change.   

June 26th - One of the most important things to watch this year: Mars Retrograde cycle -  Bitcoin 0.81%  0.66% is very sensitive to anything with Mars.  Gann  said Mars is the 'trigger' for trends and activity.

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.82%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.82%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.82%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.82%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.82%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.82%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.82%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.24%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.82%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin              has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin              will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin              which might see  Bitcoin              move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin              so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved. 

I will continue to update this analysis if enough people request it.

1530249731.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Remains Neutral Despite 4% Decline on Friday,"
 Bitcoin              has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin              will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin              has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD              so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD              buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD              pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD              pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.80%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.80%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.80%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.80%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.80%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.80%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered  

This is more than 2.000.000.000,00 USD per day almoust the  volume  of  American Express 0.01%  0.01%

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.83%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.83%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.83%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.83%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.83%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.83%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.81%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.81%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.81%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.81%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.81%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.81%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.81%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 1.18%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.81%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.83%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.83%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.83%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.83%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.83%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin 0.83%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.83%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.83%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.83%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.83%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.83%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.83%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.81%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.81%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.81%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.81%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.09%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.81%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.80%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.80%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.80%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.80%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.80%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

1530249731.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Remains Neutral Despite 4% Decline on Friday,"
 Bitcoin 0.80%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.80%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.80%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.80%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.80%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.80%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.80%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.80%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.80%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.80%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.80%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.80%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.80%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.84%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.84%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.84%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

Time is the reason for trend changes and price action.  

1. Trends do not change due to sentiment.  
2. Trends do not change due to news.  
3. Trends do not change due to Tweets.  
4. Trends do not change due to dynamic areas of  support and resistance  .

6. Trends do not change due to oscillators being in elevated conditions.  
7. Trends do not change due to  trend lines  .  

Trends change because of set pattern in time.  

1. Trends change due to a set path and pattern that Man can not deviate from; we are slaves to this pattern.  
2. The pattern that price follows is as static and natural as anything in nature: the rotation of the planets, the Fibonacci ratio, the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.  

You can believe or not believe, but  Gann  believed God created all of Creation.  Gann  also concluded that it was imposible for there to be randomness in nature or in human behavior, that a God who created everything must have a supreme order and logic to His creation.  

June 22nd - Jul7th is where we will see a reversal beginning in  Bitcoin 0.84%  0.66% . When the dynamic angular and Square time cycles, that have been applied to price, fail to initiate reversal points, the static time cycles WILL. June 22nd - July 7th is one of those static time cycles. Observe the  DXY -0.42%  -0.45% (  Dollar Index -0.17%  -0.04% ), that will reverse as well: it has already shown signs of it's trend reversal.  

Consider the following as well:  

July 1st - Uranus (harbinger of change in financial markets) exits Taurus (Taurus, the bull, is the money and stock market) indicating change.   

June 26th - One of the most important things to watch this year: Mars Retrograde cycle -  Bitcoin 0.84%  0.66% is very sensitive to anything with Mars.  Gann  said Mars is the 'trigger' for trends and activity.

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.80%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.80%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.80%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.80%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.80%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.80%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.80%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 1.19%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.80%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.80%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.80%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.80%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.80%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.80%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin 0.81%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.81%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.81%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.81%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.81%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.81%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.81%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.

 Bitcoin 0.82%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.82%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.82%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.82%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.82%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.80%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.80%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.80%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.80%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.80%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.80%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.80%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.80%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.80%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.80%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.80%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.80%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.80%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 1.20%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.80%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin              has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin              will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin              which might see  Bitcoin              move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin              so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin              has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin              will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD              for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin              rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin              quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD              will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD              will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin              rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.82%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.32%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.82%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin              has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin              will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin              which might see  Bitcoin              move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin              so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin              has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin              will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin              has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD              so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD              buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD              pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD              pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.80%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.80%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.80%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.80%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.80%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.80%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.81%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.81%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.81%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.81%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.81%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.81%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered  

This is more than 2.000.000.000,00 USD per day almoust the  volume  of  American Express 0.01%  0.01%

Time is the reason for trend changes and price action.  

1. Trends do not change due to sentiment.  
2. Trends do not change due to news.  
3. Trends do not change due to Tweets.  
4. Trends do not change due to dynamic areas of  support and resistance  .  
5. Trends do not change due to a moving average crossover.  
6. Trends do not change due to oscillators being in elevated conditions.  
7. Trends do not change due to  trend lines  .  

Trends change because of set pattern in time.  

1. Trends change due to a set path and pattern that Man can not deviate from; we are slaves to this pattern.  
2. The pattern that price follows is as static and natural as anything in nature: the rotation of the planets, the Fibonacci ratio, the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.  

You can believe or not believe, but  Gann  believed God created all of Creation.  Gann  also concluded that it was imposible for there to be randomness in nature or in human behavior, that a God who created everything must have a supreme order and logic to His creation.  

June 22nd - Jul7th is where we will see a reversal beginning in  Bitcoin 0.81%  0.66% . When the dynamic angular and Square time cycles, that have been applied to price, fail to initiate reversal points, the static time cycles WILL. June 22nd - July 7th is one of those static time cycles. Observe the  DXY -0.44%  -0.45% (  Dollar Index -0.04%  -0.04% ), that will reverse as well: it has already shown signs of it's trend reversal.  

Consider the following as well:  

July 1st - Uranus (harbinger of change in financial markets) exits Taurus (Taurus, the bull, is the money and stock market) indicating change.   

June 26th - One of the most important things to watch this year: Mars Retrograde cycle -  Bitcoin 0.81%  0.66% is very sensitive to anything with Mars.  Gann  said Mars is the 'trigger' for trends and activity.

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.80%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.80%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.80%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.80%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.80%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.80%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.80%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.31%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.80%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin              has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin              will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin              which might see  Bitcoin              move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin              so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin              has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin              will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin              has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD              so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD              buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD              pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD              pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.80%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved. 

I will continue to update this analysis if enough people request it.

1530249731.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Remains Neutral Despite 4% Decline on Friday,"
 Bitcoin 0.80%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.80%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.80%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.80%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.80%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.80%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.80%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.81%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.81%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.81%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.81%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.81%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.81%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.79%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.79%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.79%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.79%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.79%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.79%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.79%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 1.27%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.79%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

Time is the reason for trend changes and price action.  

1. Trends do not change due to sentiment.  
2. Trends do not change due to news.  
3. Trends do not change due to Tweets.  
4. Trends do not change due to dynamic areas of  support and resistance  .

6. Trends do not change due to oscillators being in elevated conditions.  
7. Trends do not change due to  trend lines  .  

Trends change because of set pattern in time.  

1. Trends change due to a set path and pattern that Man can not deviate from; we are slaves to this pattern.  
2. The pattern that price follows is as static and natural as anything in nature: the rotation of the planets, the Fibonacci ratio, the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.  

You can believe or not believe, but  Gann  believed God created all of Creation.  Gann  also concluded that it was imposible for there to be randomness in nature or in human behavior, that a God who created everything must have a supreme order and logic to His creation.  

June 22nd - Jul7th is where we will see a reversal beginning in  Bitcoin 0.78%  0.66% . When the dynamic angular and Square time cycles, that have been applied to price, fail to initiate reversal points, the static time cycles WILL. June 22nd - July 7th is one of those static time cycles. Observe the  DXY -0.42%  -0.45% (  Dollar Index 0.01%  -0.04% ), that will reverse as well: it has already shown signs of it's trend reversal.  

Consider the following as well:

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.80%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.80%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.80%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.80%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.80%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.80%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.79%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 1.25%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.79%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.79%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.79%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.79%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.79%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.79%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin 0.80%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.80%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.79%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.79%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.79%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.79%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.79%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.78%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.78%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.78%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.78%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.78%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.78%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered  

This is more than 2.000.000.000,00 USD per day almoust the  volume  of  American Express 0.01%  0.01%

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.70%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.70%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.70%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.70%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.70%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.70%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered  

This is more than 2.000.000.000,00 USD per day almoust the  volume  of  American Express 0.01%  0.01%

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.70%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.70%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.70%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.70%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.70%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.70%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.70%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.14%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.70%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.69%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.69%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.69%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.69%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.69%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin 0.70%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.70%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.70%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.70%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.70%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.70%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.70%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD              will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD              will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin              rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.77%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.34%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.77%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin              has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin              will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin              which might see  Bitcoin              move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin              so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved. 

I will continue to update this analysis if enough people request it.

1530249731.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Remains Neutral Despite 4% Decline on Friday,"
 Bitcoin              has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin              will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin              has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD              so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD              buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD              pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD              pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.77%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.77%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.77%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.77%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.77%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.77%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.80%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.80%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.80%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered  

This is more than 2.000.000.000,00 USD per day almoust the  volume  of  American Express 0.01%  0.01%

June 22nd - Jul7th is where we will see a reversal beginning in  Bitcoin 0.80%  0.66% . When the dynamic angular and Square time cycles, that have been applied to price, fail to initiate reversal points, the static time cycles WILL.

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.80%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.80%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.80%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.80%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.80%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.80%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.80%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 1.24%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.80%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.80%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.80%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.80%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.80%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.80%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin              has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin              will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin              has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD              so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD              buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD              pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD              pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.

3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin              has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD              so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD              buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD              pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD              pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.87%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.87%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.87%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.87%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.87%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.87%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.89%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.89%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.89%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.89%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.89%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.89%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.89%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 1.18%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.89%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin              has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin              will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin              which might see  Bitcoin              move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin              so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved. 

I will continue to update this analysis if enough people request it.

 Bitcoin 0.89%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.89%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

Time is the reason for trend changes and price action.

4. Trends do not change due to dynamic areas of  support and resistance  .

Trends change because of set pattern in time.  

1. Trends change due to a set path and pattern that Man can not deviate from; we are slaves to this pattern.  
2. The pattern that price follows is as static and natural as anything in nature: the rotation of the planets, the Fibonacci ratio, the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.  

You can believe or not believe, but  Gann  believed God created all of Creation.  Gann  also concluded that it was imposible for there to be randomness in nature or in human behavior, that a God who created everything must have a supreme order and logic to His creation.  

June 22nd - Jul7th is where we will see a reversal beginning in  Bitcoin 0.88%  0.66% . When the dynamic angular and Square time cycles, that have been applied to price, fail to initiate reversal points, the static time cycles WILL. June 22nd - July 7th is one of those static time cycles.

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.86%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.86%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.86%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.86%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.86%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.86%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.85%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 1.17%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.85%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.83%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.83%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.83%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.83%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.83%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved.

 Bitcoin 0.85%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.85%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.

 Bitcoin 0.85%  has fallen to a fresh 2018 trading-low this morning, as sellers finally pushed price below the key February 2nd trading-low, at $5,848. 

The broader-cryptocurrency market is also coming under further selling pressure on Friday, with  BTCUSD 0.85%  so far finding intraday support from the just above $5,700 level. 

Sellers will likely target the $5,600 level, while  BTCUSD 0.85%  buyers will need to move price back above $5,848 to relieve selling pressures. 

The  BTCUSD 0.85%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $5,848 level, key technical support is now located at the $5,600 and $5,220 levels. 

If the  BTCUSD 0.85%  pair moves above the $5,848 level, price may correct back towards the $5,951 and $6,058 resistance levels.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.86%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.86%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.86%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.86%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.86%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.86%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered

On the  BTC 0.82% daily chart , is in a short-term  downward channel  from the beginning of May until the end of June. The break out is imminent. We'll probably rally at the beginning of July. I think a reasonable target is around 7700-8100.

This charts show how reversal is imminent, it could happend any moment.  

T.A. tells that uptrend stop by triangle or lateral will continue uptrend, also the  Bitcoin 0.82%  is like in the middle of the big channel, it has momentum to get to the resistance line of the channel.  

Also, there is market manipulation, to get more  Bitcoins 0.82%  cheaper, the big players has more information than us, but we have some... and this is fundamental:  

-  Bitcoin 0.82%  -0.48% get from 10$ to 1000$ in one year when there was only 8 Million printed/created/on circulation, and 2,5 Million where printed in that time.  

There was a fall to 100$ price, because the market was to young and not to many people adopted.  

- By now the world knows  Bitcoins 0.82%  are real, there is no scam, and they can use as money all around the globe. Internet Money, with everything on internet right now. It is the more efficient way to send money right now.  

- There is much lets  Bitcoins 0.82%  printed, and much more people want them.  
The last year only 800k were printed, 1/3 printed from 2012 to 2013 the year we rise from 10$ to 1000$. 2018 we will print like 630k, 1/4 printed on 2012. So we have a potencial of no less than *100 of the price, if we repeat the history.  

If we had the same speculation we could get from 6k to 600k $ in just one year, or more because of the amount printed by now. Im assuming that the same speculation would not happend again, there is to much players by now.  

- The number of transactions was between 5k to 50k per day from 2012 to 2013,  
by now we have 160k to 350k transactions per day, the global adoption is taking place.  

- The numer of  Bitcoins 0.82%  -0.48% sended per day was about 300k by 2012, right now it is like 1M but there has been days in between with 20M transfered  

This is more than 2.000.000.000,00 USD per day almoust the  volume  of  American Express 0.01%  0.01%

Time is the reason for trend changes and price action.  

1. Trends do not change due to sentiment.  
2. Trends do not change due to news.  
3. Trends do not change due to Tweets.  
4. Trends do not change due to dynamic areas of  support and resistance  .  
5. Trends do not change due to a moving average crossover.  
6. Trends do not change due to oscillators being in elevated conditions.  
7. Trends do not change due to  trend lines  .  

Trends change because of set pattern in time.  

1. Trends change due to a set path and pattern that Man can not deviate from; we are slaves to this pattern.  
2. The pattern that price follows is as static and natural as anything in nature: the rotation of the planets, the Fibonacci ratio, the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.  

You can believe or not believe, but  Gann  believed God created all of Creation.  Gann  also concluded that it was imposible for there to be randomness in nature or in human behavior, that a God who created everything must have a supreme order and logic to His creation.  

June 22nd - Jul7th is where we will see a reversal beginning in  Bitcoin 0.82%  0.66% . When the dynamic angular and Square time cycles, that have been applied to price, fail to initiate reversal points, the static time cycles WILL. June 22nd - July 7th is one of those static time cycles. Observe the  DXY -0.41%  -0.45% (  Dollar Index -0.01%  -0.04% ), that will reverse as well: it has already shown signs of it's trend reversal.  

Consider the following as well:  

July 1st - Uranus (harbinger of change in financial markets) exits Taurus (Taurus, the bull, is the money and stock market) indicating change.   

June 26th - One of the most important things to watch this year: Mars Retrograde cycle -  Bitcoin 0.82%  0.66% is very sensitive to anything with Mars.  Gann  said Mars is the 'trigger' for trends and activity.

Bitcoin's rate is dominated by bears. 
Priority of the day: sell  BTCUSD 0.82%  for $ 5500. 
Unfortunately, bears were able to absorb the entire growth of  Bitcoin 0.82%  rate over the past week. At such rate, the fall of  Bitcoin 0.82%  quotations can soon reach targets of $ 5500 and $ 5000. 
This is not the best place for Bitcoin's sales deals for us, because the downward movement of its rate has already been going on for a long time, and there has not been a good upward correction. Therefore, we do not hurry to join the feast of the bears. 
Today there may be a culmination of the fall of Bitcoin's rate down, followed by a sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000 or even $ 6200. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.82%  will decrease from $ 6000 to $ 5500. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.82%  will be in a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
Alternative scenario: 
We have already missed out on the last move down the  Bitcoin 0.82%  rate, so we plan to join the deep correction of its price upwards. We will wait for the sharp bounce of Bitcoin's rate upwards, to $ 6000, $ 62000.

Bitcoin 0.81%  is going through Wave (3) of Wave C, this Wave C starts from Feb 2018 and will not end anytime soon, probably not this year. I think this Wave C is part of a Wave IV cycle, as the Wave  III 0.15%  top is $20000. When Wave IV finishes,  BTC 0.81%  could rally up to $130000 in a couple of years,  I will explain the mechanism of this potential rally later, in another idea article. 

For now, it's time to margin short, or wait for lower levels of entry if you're not into margin trading. Margin traders should be careful though, $4600-5000 offers strong support and a good base for powerful short squeeze, protect your profits wisely.

 Bitcoin 0.81%  has been trading down strongly after the  flag pattern  breakout confirmed on 22nd June, price is now in wave 3 of the  flag pattern , and shall the measure move target be hit, then  Bitcoin 0.81%  will continue to the downside to the  support level  which also coincides with the  Fibonacci extension  level at 5360. When price arrives at 5360 target, there is a possibility of a new bounce in  Bitcoin 0.81%  which might see  Bitcoin 0.81%  move higher. 

As price has descended, a side-wards resistance structure also formed and is proving to be a large influence on price by keeping price down when there is a retest of resistance structure. there is a small  structure support  at 5790 which could also be a small bounce for  Bitcoin 0.81%  so it is worth watching this level to see if there is any type of bounce here.  

Bear in mind that the  flag pattern  completion at target at 5360 is conditional because if price breaks above the dotted side-wards resistance line on my chart then it could mean there is a change of trend for the time being, and the flag measure move target may not be achieved. 

I will continue to update this analysis if enough people request it.

1530249731.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Remains Neutral Despite 4% Decline on Friday,"
 Bitcoin 0.81%  has lost almost four percent in the past 24 hours, but in general, the situation is neutral as the price has not established new lows, bears seem unable to make it as bulls do not let them push the currency pair lower. 
When we zoom in the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has broken through the  support area  at $6,071 on Friday and is testing the last retracement level 4.236. If bears are successful, they will be able to reach the next support at $5,715. The possible ways for BTC/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will confirm the breakout of 4.236 and move lower targeting the next support at $5,715.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Bitcoin 0.81%  will stay within the range and fail its  support area  testing. The price will fluctuate within the support at 4.236 and the resistance at $6,071. We think that this scenario is most likely than the others for Friday. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will jump over the resistance at $6,071 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,329.
