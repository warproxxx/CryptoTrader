1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




32 minutes ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.33%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.33%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.33% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.33%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

 BTCUSD -0.33%  broke that 4h  trendline  and is now forming a flag. If you look more precisely you can see it's printing a reversal  head and shoulders  pattern  too. We should get now a correction to about 7750, if the daily  trendline  and the zone gets broken we should be seeing the pair at about 10k again soon.

hello guys 
if you check out the one month chart of  bitcoin -0.33%  you could see that the  volume  is going down and the  macd  and macd4c shows the price should go under the water for flying again. also  RSI  can continue it's consolidating around the bottom. 
in other hands, the  gold -0.23%  price bounced back from 1240$ and now 5d chart of  gold -0.23%  shows the price can go higher and continue rising. the  gold -0.23%  touched the  trend line  of 98's again and can see a new  ATH 1.15% . ok, why you consider gold? are you crazy? aaah no guys, i just comment it to your eyes to show you money is money and transferable around markets. people don't think about crypto/coin/token. they just trading. right??? 
so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that. 
stay tuned

Possible  head and shoulders  forming on the 4 hour. A break of 6400s will be short signal with a stop at top of right shoulder at 6644. Targets will be 6200s, 5900s, previous local bottom in 5700s. A bounce with strong  volume  from the neck line will be a signal for longer term  bullish trend .

A quick chart :) 
Bearish  divergence in the 4h chart, 1d massively overbought, means that we need to dip before further rise. 

Area of 6100-6300 good support. 

Then it probably will resume the climb towards high 7ks, low 8ks.

Just look for yourselves.  I see V.I(+) going up, V.I.(-) going down,  MACD  looking like a soft cross to continued increase,  volume  has normalized.  AutoFib is curling up.  I say we hit 8.7 before the next concern.  Will confirm with  Euro 0.45%  chart. 

HOWEVER... we have not found a true bottom... Even if the auto fib is curling up, that doesn't mean it is impossible for there to be another sudden drop... 

Declines have been less dramatic then they were in the past though.

1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




34 minutes ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.35%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.35%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.35% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.35%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

in other hands, the  gold -0.23%  price bounced back from 1240$ and now 5d chart of  gold -0.23%  shows the price can go higher and continue rising. the  gold -0.23%  touched the  trend line  of 98's again and can see a new  ATH 1.15% . ok, why you consider gold? are you crazy? aaah no guys, i just comment it to your eyes to show you money is money and transferable around markets. people don't think about crypto/coin/token. they just trading. right??? 
so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that.

hello guys 
if you check out the one month chart of  bitcoin -0.35%  you could see that the  volume  is going down and the  macd  and macd4c shows the price should go under the water for flying again. also  RSI  can continue it's consolidating around the bottom. 
in other hands, the  gold -0.23%  price bounced back from 1240$ and now 5d chart of  gold -0.23%  shows the price can go higher and continue rising. the  gold -0.23%  touched the  trend line  of 98's again and can see a new  ATH 1.15% . ok, why you consider gold? are you crazy? aaah no guys, i just comment it to your eyes to show you money is money and transferable around markets. people don't think about crypto/coin/token. they just trading. right??? 
so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that. 
stay tuned

1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




36 minutes ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.35%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.35%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.35% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.35%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

 BTCUSD              broke that 4h  trendline  and is now forming a flag. If you look more precisely you can see it's printing a reversal  head and shoulders  pattern  too. We should get now a correction to about 7750, if the daily  trendline  and the zone gets broken we should be seeing the pair at about 10k again soon.

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.35% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.35%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that.

Bearish  divergence in the 4h chart, 1d massively overbought, means that we need to dip before further rise.

In this day chart of  BTC -0.35%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch.

1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




40 minutes ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.36%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.36%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.36% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.36%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

if you check out the one month chart of  bitcoin -0.35%  you could see that the  volume  is going down and the  macd  and macd4c shows the price should go under the water for flying again. also  RSI  can continue it's consolidating around the bottom. 
in other hands, the  gold -0.23%  price bounced back from 1240$ and now 5d chart of  gold -0.23%  shows the price can go higher and continue rising. the  gold -0.23%  touched the  trend line  of 98's again and can see a new  ATH 1.15% . ok, why you consider gold? are you crazy? aaah no guys, i just comment it to your eyes to show you money is money and transferable around markets. people don't think about crypto/coin/token. they just trading. right??? 
so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that. 
stay tuned

hello guys 
if you check out the one month chart of  bitcoin -0.37%  you could see that the  volume  is going down and the  macd  and macd4c shows the price should go under the water for flying again. also  RSI  can continue it's consolidating around the bottom. 
in other hands, the  gold -0.23%  price bounced back from 1240$ and now 5d chart of  gold -0.23%  shows the price can go higher and continue rising. the  gold -0.23%  touched the  trend line  of 98's again and can see a new  ATH 1.15% . ok, why you consider gold? are you crazy? aaah no guys, i just comment it to your eyes to show you money is money and transferable around markets. people don't think about crypto/coin/token. they just trading. right??? 
so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that. 
stay tuned 
Thank you for like and comment

Bearish  divergence in the 4h chart, 1d massively overbought, means that we need to dip before further rise.

1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




43 minutes ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.37%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.37%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.37% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.37%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

 BTCUSD -0.37%  broke that 4h  trendline  and is now forming a flag. If you look more precisely you can see it's printing a reversal  head and shoulders  pattern  too. We should get now a correction to about 7750, if the daily  trendline  and the zone gets broken we should be seeing the pair at about 10k again soon.

I am going to buy  BTC -0.38%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that.

an hour ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.38%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.38%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.38% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment?

1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




an hour ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.40%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.40%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.40% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.40%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

hello guys 
if you check out the one month chart of  bitcoin -0.40%  you could see that the  volume  is going down and the  macd  and macd4c shows the price should go under the water for flying again. also  RSI  can continue it's consolidating around the bottom. 
in other hands, the  gold -0.23%  price bounced back from 1240$ and now 5d chart of  gold -0.23%  shows the price can go higher and continue rising. the  gold -0.23%  touched the  trend line  of 98's again and can see a new  ATH 1.15% . ok, why you consider gold? are you crazy? aaah no guys, i just comment it to your eyes to show you money is money and transferable around markets. people don't think about crypto/coin/token. they just trading. right??? 
so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that. 
stay tuned

hello guys 
if you check out the one month chart of  bitcoin -0.46%  you could see that the  volume  is going down and the  macd  and macd4c shows the price should go under the water for flying again. also  RSI  can continue it's consolidating around the bottom. 
in other hands, the  gold -0.23%  price bounced back from 1240$ and now 5d chart of  gold -0.23%  shows the price can go higher and continue rising. the  gold -0.23%  touched the  trend line  of 98's again and can see a new  ATH 1.15% . ok, why you consider gold? are you crazy? aaah no guys, i just comment it to your eyes to show you money is money and transferable around markets. people don't think about crypto/coin/token. they just trading. right??? 
so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that. 
stay tuned 
Thank you for like and comment

Bearish  divergence in the 4h chart, 1d massively overbought, means that we need to dip before further rise.

1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




an hour ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.46%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.46%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.46% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.46%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

 BTCUSD -0.46%  broke that 4h  trendline  and is now forming a flag. If you look more precisely you can see it's printing a reversal  head and shoulders  pattern  too. We should get now a correction to about 7750, if the daily  trendline  and the zone gets broken we should be seeing the pair at about 10k again soon.

Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that.

1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




an hour ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.46%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.46%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.46% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.46%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what.

Just look for yourselves.  I see V.I(+) going up, V.I.(-) going down,  MACD  looking like a soft cross to continued increase,  volume  has normalized.  AutoFib is curling up.  I say we hit 8.7 before the next concern.  Will confirm with  Euro              chart.

1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




an hour ago




In this day chart of  BTC              you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC              price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC             , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC              below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

hello guys 
if you check out the one month chart of  bitcoin -0.46%  you could see that the  volume  is going down and the  macd  and macd4c shows the price should go under the water for flying again. also  RSI  can continue it's consolidating around the bottom. 
in other hands, the  gold -0.23%  price bounced back from 1240$ and now 5d chart of  gold -0.23%  shows the price can go higher and continue rising. the  gold -0.23%  touched the  trend line  of 98's again and can see a new  ATH             . ok, why you consider gold? are you crazy? aaah no guys, i just comment it to your eyes to show you money is money and transferable around markets. people don't think about crypto/coin/token. they just trading. right??? 
so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that. 
stay tuned 
Thank you for like and comment

if you check out the one month chart of  bitcoin -0.39%  you could see that the  volume  is going down and the  macd  and macd4c shows the price should go under the water for flying again. also  RSI  can continue it's consolidating around the bottom. 
in other hands, the  gold -0.23%  price bounced back from 1240$ and now 5d chart of  gold -0.23%  shows the price can go higher and continue rising. the  gold -0.23%  touched the  trend line  of 98's again and can see a new  ATH 1.15% . ok, why you consider gold? are you crazy? aaah no guys, i just comment it to your eyes to show you money is money and transferable around markets. people don't think about crypto/coin/token. they just trading. right??? 
so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that. 
stay tuned 
Thank you for like and comment

Bearish  divergence in the 4h chart, 1d massively overbought, means that we need to dip before further rise.

1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




an hour ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.36%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.36%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.36% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.36%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

 BTCUSD -0.36%  broke that 4h  trendline  and is now forming a flag. If you look more precisely you can see it's printing a reversal  head and shoulders  pattern  too. We should get now a correction to about 7750, if the daily  trendline  and the zone gets broken we should be seeing the pair at about 10k again soon.

And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

hello guys 
if you check out the one month chart of  bitcoin -0.35%  you could see that the  volume  is going down and the  macd  and macd4c shows the price should go under the water for flying again. also  RSI  can continue it's consolidating around the bottom. 
in other hands, the  gold -0.23%  price bounced back from 1240$ and now 5d chart of  gold -0.23%  shows the price can go higher and continue rising. the  gold -0.23%  touched the  trend line  of 98's again and can see a new  ATH 1.15% . ok, why you consider gold? are you crazy? aaah no guys, i just comment it to your eyes to show you money is money and transferable around markets. people don't think about crypto/coin/token. they just trading. right??? 
so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that. 
stay tuned

1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




an hour ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.35%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.35%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.35% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.35%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




an hour ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.34%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.34%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.34% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.34%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that.

an hour ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.25%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.25%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.25% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.25%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

 BTCUSD -0.25%  broke that 4h  trendline  and is now forming a flag. If you look more precisely you can see it's printing a reversal  head and shoulders  pattern  too. We should get now a correction to about 7750, if the daily  trendline  and the zone gets broken we should be seeing the pair at about 10k again soon.

in other hands, the  gold -0.23%  price bounced back from 1240$ and now 5d chart of  gold -0.23%  shows the price can go higher and continue rising. the  gold -0.23%  touched the  trend line  of 98's again and can see a new  ATH             . ok, why you consider gold? are you crazy? aaah no guys, i just comment it to your eyes to show you money is money and transferable around markets. people don't think about crypto/coin/token. they just trading. right??? 
so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that. 
stay tuned

1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




an hour ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.26%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.26%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.26% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.26%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




an hour ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.26%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.26%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.26% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.26%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

 BTCUSD              broke that 4h  trendline  and is now forming a flag. If you look more precisely you can see it's printing a reversal  head and shoulders  pattern  too. We should get now a correction to about 7750, if the daily  trendline  and the zone gets broken we should be seeing the pair at about 10k again soon.

so what's next?

1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




an hour ago




In this day chart of  BTC              you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC              price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC             , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC              below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

in other hands, the  gold -0.23%  price bounced back from 1240$ and now 5d chart of  gold -0.23%  shows the price can go higher and continue rising. the  gold -0.23%  touched the  trend line  of 98's again and can see a new  ATH             . ok, why you consider gold? are you crazy? aaah no guys, i just comment it to your eyes to show you money is money and transferable around markets. people don't think about crypto/coin/token. they just trading. right??? 
so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that. 
stay tuned

in other hands, the  gold -0.23%  price bounced back from 1240$ and now 5d chart of  gold -0.23%  shows the price can go higher and continue rising. the  gold -0.23%  touched the  trend line  of 98's again and can see a new  ATH 1.15% . ok, why you consider gold? are you crazy? aaah no guys, i just comment it to your eyes to show you money is money and transferable around markets. people don't think about crypto/coin/token. they just trading. right??? 
so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that. 
stay tuned

1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




an hour ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.27%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.27%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.27% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.27%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

 BTCUSD -0.27%  broke that 4h  trendline  and is now forming a flag. If you look more precisely you can see it's printing a reversal  head and shoulders  pattern  too. We should get now a correction to about 7750, if the daily  trendline  and the zone gets broken we should be seeing the pair at about 10k again soon.

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC             , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC              below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

so what's next?

1530955729.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Where to start buying in? Main long-term support line,"




an hour ago




In this day chart of  BTC -0.22%  you can see the main green line, that has acted as MAIN RESISTANCE LINE from the market top in mid December 2017, until it started acting as MAIN SUPPORT LINE starting from mid April 2018. From time to time it gets re-confirmed as support line, such as recently in June 2018. So, this green line is clearly a very important line to watch. 

I'm expecting that the market will continue to drift lower, but that  BTC -0.22%  price will stay above this green line. So, this may give us an indication about price/time levels in the months ahead. 

I think we may find our lowest price point somewhere in August or September 2018 (to be confirmed as bottom with hindsight much later on), and that from there we will move sideways for a rather long period of time, perhaps even for several months. 

Now, there are roughly 2 possibilities about how the market will bottom. There may be either a sharp sell-off and then a V-shaped recovery; or a slow grinding down, and a recovery in the form of a  cup and handle  formation. I think we will mainly see a slow grinding down. Nevertheless, at some point there may also still be a relatively minor sudden and sharp sell-off. 

How to deal with this situation if you are a long-term bull, like me? How to buy  BTC -0.22% , in order to then hold it long term as an investment? I am going to buy  BTC -0.22%  below USD 5,000 in increments whenever the prices goes back to the green line or slightly above, so that I'm about half invested - so as to be invested and not to miss the boat when suddenly the market would take off. And I'm also going to keep about 50% of my powder dry, so as to buy at very reduced price levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Under no condition will I sell what I have bought. In the time ahead there may be tremendous pressure on the bulls to sell their holdings (thinking that they can buy back at lower prices), and this pressure may be very, very hard to resist, maybe almost impossible to resist. Therefore, I continue to make up my mind that I'm not going to sell, no matter what. So, I will hold whatever I have bought, and at the same time I will keep some powder dry in order to buy at much lower levels in case of a sharp sell-off. 

Best of luck with your trading.

					Another BEARISH CROSSOVER in the daily chart: 
In this daily chart you can also see the 144-daily EMA in red colour; and the 233-daily EMA in orange colour - I use Fibonacci numbers for my exponential moving averages (EMA).  
Now, as you can see we are having a bearish crossover from the shorter term (144-daily EMA) below the longer term (233-EMA) moving averages. This particular bearish crossover on the daily chart is the first since november 2015. And this is one of the reasons why I'm expecting the BTC price to still go substantially lower, and also remain low for an extended period of time, in the months ahead.

 BTCUSD -0.22%  broke that 4h  trendline  and is now forming a flag. If you look more precisely you can see it's printing a reversal  head and shoulders  pattern  too. We should get now a correction to about 7750, if the daily  trendline  and the zone gets broken we should be seeing the pair at about 10k again soon.

hello guys 
if you check out the one month chart of  bitcoin -0.22%  you could see that the  volume  is going down and the  macd  and macd4c shows the price should go under the water for flying again. also  RSI  can continue it's consolidating around the bottom. 
in other hands, the  gold -0.23%  price bounced back from 1240$ and now 5d chart of  gold -0.23%  shows the price can go higher and continue rising. the  gold -0.23%  touched the  trend line  of 98's again and can see a new  ATH 1.15% . ok, why you consider gold? are you crazy? aaah no guys, i just comment it to your eyes to show you money is money and transferable around markets. people don't think about crypto/coin/token. they just trading. right??? 
so what's next? 
in the one day chart i expect short and drop to 6100 again for making  inverse h&s  and rise again after that. 
stay tuned
