So, I'm not saying this won't be invalidated. I see a lot of  bullish  signals in DASH like  bullish divergence  in 1 day recently and I like this asset a LOT. That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.  

Just sharing my observation. You decide your own position on it.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr 0.56%  chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

					I'm moving the stop up to $253. This guarantees a winning trade. More details coming as I am also exiting a few positions here.

					
				






Jun 17





Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable. 













Jun 18





Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner. 

I'm not officially posting, but I did reenter on that 'normal' action on the bitfinex btc chart...will use same stop and targets.

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...  

Thanks for viewing.

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.65%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

Comment:
					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.55%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

So, I'm not saying this won't be invalidated. I see a lot of  bullish  signals in DASH like  bullish divergence  in 1 day recently and I like this asset a LOT. That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr 0.56%  chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

					I'm moving the stop up to $253. This guarantees a winning trade. More details coming as I am also exiting a few positions here.

					
				






Jun 17





Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable. 













Jun 18





Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner.

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...  

Thanks for viewing.

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.49%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

So, I'm not saying this won't be invalidated. I see a lot of  bullish  signals in DASH like  bullish divergence  in 1 day recently and I like this asset a LOT. That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr 0.56%  chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

Trade active:
					I'm moving the stop up to $253. This guarantees a winning trade. More details coming as I am also exiting a few positions here.

					
				






Jun 17





Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable. 













Jun 18





Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner. 

I'm not officially posting, but I did reenter on that 'normal' action on the bitfinex btc chart...will use same stop and targets.

Pretty simple. On the 3  hr 0.56%  chart, DASHUSD has been in a channel for about a week.

I still would like to see another round of more lows in the overall market, so i will exit this trade at the target and reassess at that point.

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable. 













Jun 18





Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner. 

I'm not officially posting, but I did reenter on that 'normal' action on the bitfinex btc chart...will use same stop and targets.

Pretty simple. On the 3  hr 0.56%  chart, DASHUSD has been in a channel for about a week.

I still would like to see another round of more lows in the overall market, so i will exit this trade at the target and reassess at that point.

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...  

Thanks for viewing.

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.49%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

So, I'm not saying this won't be invalidated. I see a lot of  bullish  signals in DASH like  bullish divergence  in 1 day recently and I like this asset a LOT. That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.  

Just sharing my observation. You decide your own position on it.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr 0.56%  chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.  

Just sharing my observation. You decide your own position on it.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr 0.56%  chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

Trade active:
					I'm moving the stop up to $253. This guarantees a winning trade. More details coming as I am also exiting a few positions here.

					
				






Jun 17





Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable. 













Jun 18





Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner. 

I'm not officially posting, but I did reenter on that 'normal' action on the bitfinex btc chart...will use same stop and targets.

Pretty simple. On the 3  hr 0.56%  chart, DASHUSD has been in a channel for about a week.  

Entry: $256.50

I still would like to see another round of more lows in the overall market, so i will exit this trade at the target and reassess at that point.

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...  

Thanks for viewing.

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.44%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

Comment:
					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.43%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

So, I'm not saying this won't be invalidated. I see a lot of  bullish  signals in DASH like  bullish divergence  in 1 day recently and I like this asset a LOT. That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr              chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

Trade active:
					I'm moving the stop up to $253. This guarantees a winning trade. More details coming as I am also exiting a few positions here.

					
				






Jun 17





Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable. 













Jun 18





Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner. 

I'm not officially posting, but I did reenter on that 'normal' action on the bitfinex btc chart...will use same stop and targets.

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...  

Thanks for viewing.

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...  

Thanks for viewing.

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.38%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

So, I'm not saying this won't be invalidated. I see a lot of  bullish  signals in DASH like  bullish divergence  in 1 day recently and I like this asset a LOT. That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.  

Just sharing my observation. You decide your own position on it.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr 0.56%  chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

					I'm moving the stop up to $253. This guarantees a winning trade. More details coming as I am also exiting a few positions here.

					
				






Jun 17





Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable. 













Jun 18





Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner. 

I'm not officially posting, but I did reenter on that 'normal' action on the bitfinex btc chart...will use same stop and targets.

Pretty simple. On the 3  hr 0.56%  chart, DASHUSD has been in a channel for about a week.  

Entry: $256.50

I still would like to see another round of more lows in the overall market, so i will exit this trade at the target and reassess at that point.

So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable.

Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner.

Pretty simple. On the 3  hr              chart, DASHUSD has been in a channel for about a week.  

Entry: $256.50

I still would like to see another round of more lows in the overall market, so i will exit this trade at the target and reassess at that point.

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...  

Thanks for viewing.

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC              is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

Comment:
					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

So, I'm not saying this won't be invalidated. I see a lot of  bullish  signals in DASH like  bullish divergence  in 1 day recently and I like this asset a LOT. That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr              chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270.

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr              chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

Trade active:
					I'm moving the stop up to $253. This guarantees a winning trade. More details coming as I am also exiting a few positions here.

					
				






Jun 17





Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable. 













Jun 18





Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner. 

I'm not officially posting, but I did reenter on that 'normal' action on the bitfinex btc chart...will use same stop and targets.

Pretty simple. On the 3  hr              chart, DASHUSD has been in a channel for about a week.  

Entry: $256.50

I still would like to see another round of more lows in the overall market, so i will exit this trade at the target and reassess at that point.

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...  

Thanks for viewing.

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.35%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

Comment:
					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

So, I'm not saying this won't be invalidated. I see a lot of  bullish  signals in DASH like  bullish divergence  in 1 day recently and I like this asset a LOT. That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.  

Just sharing my observation. You decide your own position on it.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.36%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

So, I'm not saying this won't be invalidated. I see a lot of  bullish  signals in DASH like  bullish divergence  in 1 day recently and I like this asset a LOT. That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.  

Just sharing my observation. You decide your own position on it.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr              chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

Trade active:
					I'm moving the stop up to $253. This guarantees a winning trade. More details coming as I am also exiting a few positions here.

					
				






Jun 17





Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable. 













Jun 18





Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner. 

I'm not officially posting, but I did reenter on that 'normal' action on the bitfinex btc chart...will use same stop and targets.

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...  

Thanks for viewing.

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...  

Thanks for viewing.

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.33%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

So, I'm not saying this won't be invalidated. I see a lot of  bullish  signals in DASH like  bullish divergence  in 1 day recently and I like this asset a LOT. That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr 0.56%  chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

					I'm moving the stop up to $253. This guarantees a winning trade. More details coming as I am also exiting a few positions here.

					
				






Jun 17





Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable. 













Jun 18





Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner.

Pretty simple. On the 3  hr              chart, DASHUSD has been in a channel for about a week.

I still would like to see another round of more lows in the overall market, so i will exit this trade at the target and reassess at that point.

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...

Pretty simple. On the 3  hr 0.56%  chart, DASHUSD has been in a channel for about a week.  

Entry: $256.50 

Stop: $250 

Target: $269 

I still would like to see another round of more lows in the overall market, so i will exit this trade at the target and reassess at that point.

					soon after this post, we saw a bit of a dump. it stopped out at $250. I used 13 DASH for this trade, so lost $85... but as I said i would like to see another round of lows, so I'm not at all emotional about this trade...i hope it helps get us closer to the bottom.

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...  

Thanks for viewing.

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.32%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

Comment:
					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

So, I'm not saying this won't be invalidated. I see a lot of  bullish  signals in DASH like  bullish divergence  in 1 day recently and I like this asset a LOT. That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr              chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

Trade active:
					I'm moving the stop up to $253. This guarantees a winning trade. More details coming as I am also exiting a few positions here.

					
				






Jun 17





Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable. 













Jun 18





Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner. 

I'm not officially posting, but I did reenter on that 'normal' action on the bitfinex btc chart...will use same stop and targets.

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr              chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

Trade active:
					I'm moving the stop up to $253. This guarantees a winning trade. More details coming as I am also exiting a few positions here.

					
				






Jun 17





Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable. 













Jun 18





Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner. 

I'm not officially posting, but I did reenter on that 'normal' action on the bitfinex btc chart...will use same stop and targets.

Pretty simple. On the 3  hr              chart, DASHUSD has been in a channel for about a week.  

Entry: $256.50

I still would like to see another round of more lows in the overall market, so i will exit this trade at the target and reassess at that point.

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...  

Thanks for viewing.

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.30%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

Comment:
					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

So, I'm not saying this won't be invalidated. I see a lot of  bullish  signals in DASH like  bullish divergence  in 1 day recently and I like this asset a LOT. That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.  

Just sharing my observation. You decide your own position on it.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr 0.56%  chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis.

So, I'm not saying this won't be invalidated. I see a lot of  bullish  signals in DASH like  bullish divergence  in 1 day recently and I like this asset a LOT. That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.  

Just sharing my observation. You decide your own position on it.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr 0.56%  chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

Trade active:
					I'm moving the stop up to $253. This guarantees a winning trade. More details coming as I am also exiting a few positions here.

					
				






Jun 17





Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable. 













Jun 18





Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner. 

I'm not officially posting, but I did reenter on that 'normal' action on the bitfinex btc chart...will use same stop and targets.

Pretty simple. On the 3  hr 0.56%  chart, DASHUSD has been in a channel for about a week.  

Entry: $256.50

I still would like to see another round of more lows in the overall market, so i will exit this trade at the target and reassess at that point.

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...  

Thanks for viewing.

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.30%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

Comment:
					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.30%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

So, I'm not saying this won't be invalidated. I see a lot of  bullish  signals in DASH like  bullish divergence  in 1 day recently and I like this asset a LOT. That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr 0.56%  chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

					I'm moving the stop up to $253. This guarantees a winning trade. More details coming as I am also exiting a few positions here.

					
				






Jun 17





Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable. 













Jun 18





Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner. 

I'm not officially posting, but I did reenter on that 'normal' action on the bitfinex btc chart...will use same stop and targets.

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...  

Thanks for viewing.

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC              is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

So, I'm not saying this won't be invalidated. I see a lot of  bullish  signals in DASH like  bullish divergence  in 1 day recently and I like this asset a LOT. That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr 0.56%  chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

Trade active:
					I'm moving the stop up to $253. This guarantees a winning trade. More details coming as I am also exiting a few positions here.

					
				






Jun 17





Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable.

Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner.

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable. 













Jun 18





Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner. 

I'm not officially posting, but I did reenter on that 'normal' action on the bitfinex btc chart...will use same stop and targets.

Pretty simple. On the 3  hr 0.56%  chart, DASHUSD has been in a channel for about a week.  

Entry: $256.50

I still would like to see another round of more lows in the overall market, so i will exit this trade at the target and reassess at that point.

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...  

Thanks for viewing.

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.30%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

So, I'm not saying this won't be invalidated. I see a lot of  bullish  signals in DASH like  bullish divergence  in 1 day recently and I like this asset a LOT. That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.  

Just sharing my observation. You decide your own position on it.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr              chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

That noted, crypto is traded on emotions and a formation like this is not something I'm going to play around with. Divergence can be invalidated in the blink of an eye. Too many other assets out there for me to play around with panic selling on this signal. I'll keep an eye out for signals it's gone bull to hedge against instead.  

Just sharing my observation. You decide your own position on it.

Hopefully you preserved much capital with my  bollinger band  squeeze warning last week. I see it possibly could be spent, and due for a little snap back rally. I have entered another short term  bullish  trade on Dash. As stated in my last  bullish  trade, I'm still not convinced the bottom is in in the overall market. But here is my explanation of the new trade. 

1)I like to look for long trades when  RSI  has a  double bottom  in the relatively extreme 20-30 range (conversely, exit trades in the 70-80 range). This becomes more attractive to me when there is either divergence, or the second low in price is drastic relative to the second  RSI  low. In this case, I'm looking at  RSI  under 21 on May 28 at $285 DASHUSD. Then  RSI  over 24 on June 11 28 at $259. And the more recent  RSI  near 32 with price under $250. It qualifies to grab my attention.  

2) We are on the 100MA on the weekly right now! 

3) We are at substantial support from October 2017 before the last rocket launch.  

4) The price of DASH is just outside the bottom of the  bollinger bands  . Which can help with any snapback similar to the action from May 12 and my last published trade May 28. 

5)  MACD  divergence.... self explanatory.  

Stop $235  
 
Buy $251  
 
Target 1: $285 (1:2.1)  
or 100 MA on the 3  hr 0.56%  chart 

Target 2: $315 (1:4)  

IF half of position is exited at first target, and half at second target, this trade will net 3R. 

This is a tight stop, because if this is the final carnage, then it could run quick...but conditions warrant a nice pop here before (if) that happens. This is my trade, tailor your own trade with your own analysis. 

Do you agree with this setup? Did you use different price levels? Feel free to comment what you are seeing. Thanks for viewing.

Trade active:
					I'm moving the stop up to $253. This guarantees a winning trade. More details coming as I am also exiting a few positions here.

					
				






Jun 17





Trade active:
					I split this trade up. I exited 30% of position here at $270. 

Of the remaining 70%... 

Half is at a stop of $253 with a target of $280... which is where the 100MA should be by that time. 

The other half is at a stop of $260 with a target of $295... which would allow for a throw over of sorts relative to the 100MA. 

See the RSI strategy below to see why these trades work, and when they exhaust. On the previous examples, the RSI bounce topped at over 60. Right now RSI is at 57. So in my opinion, I really need to see a new high in price, or divergence (albeit slight) sets up the other way... That is the reason for all the actions. 

With these moves, the max R value for the trade is 1.8R .... the worst the trade can do is make .6R... so either way, it is profitable. 













Jun 18





Trade closed: stop reached:
					This trade is closed, as it was stopped out on the new stop. Finished making .6R , I really thought it would have made a bit more than that...but still a winner. 

I'm not officially posting, but I did reenter on that 'normal' action on the bitfinex btc chart...will use same stop and targets.

Pretty simple. On the 3  hr              chart, DASHUSD has been in a channel for about a week.  

Entry: $256.50

I still would like to see another round of more lows in the overall market, so i will exit this trade at the target and reassess at that point.

What do I look for when using RSI? 

Using  RSI , you can get a framework of when to get into a trade or not.  

In my experience, this strategy works more than half of the time. So if you are using the proper risk, this strategy should be profitable. In this particular example, the strategy actually worked 100% of the time. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

1. Look for  RSI  to be reach an oversold level..the furthest below 30 the better. 

2. It may be tempting to 'buy the bottom', but not yet! Instead, watch for divergence on a subsequent low. THERE is where you want to get in.... the second oversold  RSI  reading that is equal to or greater than the first  RSI  reading. Also, the price obviously must be much lower on the second  RSI  reading, than the prior lower  RSI  reading. 

3. Set your target... Many times, the corrective bounce travels 1 - 2.618 times the price difference between the corresponding  RSI  lows.  
For example: May 8 -  RSI  26.6 and price $417  
May 11 -  RSI  28 and price $378 
417-378 = 39 
May 14 -  RSI  65 and price $444 
444-378 = 66 .....  66/39 = 1.69 

Also, as you can see, the 100 MA is a pretty good place to target. 

AND   RSI  getting over 60 is a good indication is has run its course. 

4. Repeat. 

This is the 3 hour time frame, but I find this works in most time frames, it just depends on how long you want to stay in trades. It can also be applied counter trend  bullish  and  bearish . When I see this divergence flipped, I use it to know to close a trade or reduce positions. 

Hope I explained it well enough. Any questions or comments, please have at it. And a like and/or follow is much appreciated. My timing has been pretty good with these lately, but not many people are actually seeing the charts...  

Thanks for viewing.

Comment:
					I should add, for this trade to work nearly 100% of time, don't be greedy. 

It's duration is relative to the amount of candles between the first lower RSI reading, and the second diverging RSI reading. Of course you could miss out on a higher run in price, but this is a good indicator to know that you have been in the trade for too long, or that it's move has exhausted.  

Examples from above:  
1st setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
2nd setup - 24 candles between RSI divergence, 19 candles for maximum trade duration. 
3rd setup - 25 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration. 
4th setup - 27 candles between RSI divergence, 25 candles for maximum trade duration.42 44 
5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.  

Whether you use this to trade on it's own, or use it when exiting other trades, please be a good steward of your wealth.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.30%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

Comment:
					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.

5th setup, 17 candles between RSI divergence, 11 candles for maximum trade duration. Coincidentally, the 5th setup, when this strategy was posted, was actually the worst performer. And yet, the strategy still proved successful.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Make it or break it point for DASH, if it breaks and closes below 236 on the Daily and the Weekly, there is a high probability it will go to $0, if this does happen I assume  BTC 0.30%  is in the midst of crashing and many coins will be in the red.  

I have placed a stop below $236 which will put me into a short if we break below and if you are following this trade and trading based upon it I would advise you to do the same thing because the structure will be invalidated if that happens. Will try to update this analysis every week or so since it is based upon weekly candles and the long-term timeframe.

Comment:
					Yellow lines are if were to take the direction of an extended wave 3, whereas the white lines are if it were to take the direction of an extended wave 5.  

Also there is bearish divergence present but this does not always mean a 100% reversal as it can also signify momentum loss and entering a range.
