# CryptoTrader
2022 November 12 Update: I have been getting a lot of stars in this repo. This algo was the first step in my algorithmic trading stint and is honestly shit. I would recommend https://github.com/warproxxx/algorithms as that one was made with a lot of effort and backtest and worked pretty well for a long time. The research used to create that is in https://gitlab.com/warproxxx/new_algos and a few summary is in my blog at https://warproxxx.github.io/






A well tested complete project to get data, clean it, analyze it and generate prediction using Machine Learning along with detailed testing of each modules and the predictions. An extremly in depth project

Uses Reddit, Twitter, Google, Historic, Technical Analysis and Blockchain based data to predict crypto currency prices. Did as my undergrad dissertation.

Uses Python 3.5 and 3.7 and a custom made backtest framework
